### Session 1: Opening

For  opening class be prepared:

- to introduce yourself to your classmates by saying something about yourself and your interest or experience in Literature and Comedy
- to read and discuss the syllabus and semester objectives for this class
- to reflect on a form of comic art—in whatever medium or venue—that you consider a good example of comedy
- to discuss  a brief video clip.

We will also sign up for:  [Annotation Studio](https://app.annotation.studio/), a useful tool for developing and sharing your readings; and in-class presentations.

### Session 2: Aristophanes, LYSISTRATA

Read the entire play, or as much as possible, preferably in print edition, though you may search at the Loeb Classic Library. 

When in doubt, assume a bawdy reading of any innuendo.

In class we will:

- Draw on Discussion forum posts to lay out critical questions and themes in our reading of *Lysistrata.*
- Review ritual bases of Greek Old Comedy (Dionysus worship)
- Learn about dramatic structure that arose from these rituals
- Look at Aristophanes in the context of Peloponnesian war and political conflict
- Consider the use in Key and Peele's "Substitute Teacher" of ritual to express and order conflict. (time permitting)
- Explore Lysistrata's "Wool" speech in Annotation Studio.

### Session 3: LYSISTRATA and CHI-RAQ

Please return to *Lysistrata*, noting concepts introduced in Thursday's discussion: plot vs. performance, invective vs. festive elements in the play; and particularly the staging of *anagnorisis*. In class we will focus on how comic recognition in *Lysistrata* takes place: what gets recognized, how does recognition happen, why is it essential for resolving conflict.

Use the Discussion forum to post responses to what you found striking at the forum or in class discussion, respond to other people's posts, or raise questions and observations of your own.

Viewing Spike Lee's film *Chi-Raq*, based on *Lysistrata,* will bring these issues into relief. In class, we will look at  a clip to focus discussion on ritual and its relationship with conflict. 

We will also view and discuss in Annotation Studio passages from the ending of *Lysistrata.* You are free to annotate before class; that activity is optional. In class we will focus on the festive, performance elements of the conclusion.

### Session 4: Plautus, THE TWO MANAECHMUSES

You can get a sense of the broad-stroke changes in comic forms as Greek Old Comedy (Aristophanes' forte) evolves into New Comedy, then Roman Comedy, `**in the handout on Greek and Roman Comedy**`. Plautus (c. 254-184 BCE) is often viewed as the epitome of Roman Comedy, and you will see both continuities and differences from Aristophanes. The second handout, comparing `**Greek and Roman Play Forms**`, may extend and clarify this point.

With Plautus we encounter farce, a comic mechanism that intensifies the effects of comic transgression in Aristophanes.

We will focus on a different version of comic masking in this play; varieties of dressing, undressing, and cross-dressing; gender jokes; and the complications (comedy of errors) rooted in an ancient plot about twins. Shakespeare loved Plautus and adapted this play for his own *Comedy of* *Errors*.

You will also observe the comic roles of subordinate and lower-caste characters--especially Peniculus the Sponge (or hanger-on) and Messenio the clever "slave." Both of these are stock characters, types that appeared in ancient comedy again and again.

The humor of men dressed as women is a staple of Billy Wilder's *Some Like It Hot*, and we will continue our discussion of gender comedy next week with that film.

### Session 5: Plautus and Billy Wilder, SOME LIKE IT HOT

In today's class we will return to our discussion of farce and look more closely at the ending of Plautus' *The Two Menaechmuses* for insight into the way he handles comic recognition/unmasking and resolution of the of the play's conflicts. Then we examine Billy Wilder's *Some Like it Hot* (1959) as twentieth-century film farce, with many elements we have seen in Plautus, though significant differences as well. If you have not commented on *Menaechmuses,* please post at the Plautus Discussion Forum; you will find a separate forum on Wilder. (Clarification: you should post on Plautus if you have not already done so; Wilder is one of the several films you can post on during the semester to get to at least ten posts.)

### Session 6: Research Workshop

For this class, you need to have selected a topic and date for your in-class oral report and be ready to locate reference and scholarly materials in the workshop . We welcome questions about the research process, as well as guidelines, as laid out in the `**handout**`. 

### Session 7: Writing Workshop

We will use class time to practice skills of peer review, working with writing partners and discussing critical writing issues. You will have until midnight `**Thursday February 24**` to hand in your final draft--enough time to make minor adjustments but not to undertake a full revision, for which you will have a separate assignment `**due March 8**`. Please bring your draft in a form you can share.
